# Swift 3 - Ubuntu v14.04 - Docker

Docker image with the Swift 3.0.1 RELEASE binaries and dependencies for running Kitura-based applications. Our development team uses this image for development and testing of Swift 3 applications on the Linux Ubuntu (v14.04) operating system.

# Recent updates
1. Upgraded Dockerfile to the Swift 3.0.1 RELEASE binaries.
2. Aligned version of Ubuntu with version found in Cloud Foundry environments (14.04).
3. Reduced size of the Docker image.
4. Updated Dockerfile per guidelines in [Best practices for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/).

# Privilege mode
If you attempt to run the Swift REPL and you get the error `failed to launch REPL process: process launch failed: 'A' packet returned an error: 8`, then you should run your Docker container in privilege mode:

```
docker run --privileged -i -t ibmcom/swift-ubuntu:latest  /bin/bash
```

This issue is described at https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-54.
